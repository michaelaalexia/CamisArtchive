    <h2 class="summary">What Cami is Doing Now : Her Education</h2>
    <p>Currently, Cami is a first year student in Bath Spa University in Ras Al Khaimah. She studies Creative Computing, 
        a three-year degree that touches on both creativity and technology. She's graduated from an international online school
        in the States called Logos Online School. She was also an alumna from The New Filipino Private School.

    <h2 class="summary">Cami's Creative Process : Her Artistic Background</h2>
    <p>Cami didn't formally take art classes growing up. She's mostly drawn based from observation and a little- no a <i>lot</i> of imagination.
        She's looked up several YouTube tutorials to serve as a stepping stone for her artistic journey. <br> <br>
        However, during the final years of her high school, she was able to take up art classes for two years which was an aid to
        hone her skills and enhance her work.
