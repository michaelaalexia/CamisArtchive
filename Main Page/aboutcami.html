        <p>Cami, or should we say, Michaela Alexia Cruz, is your average university student. When she isn't busy meeting with people or 
            doing projects, you would find her parked in front of her sketchbook or drawing tablet, creating either an intricate work or a random doodle. 
            She has always had an affinity for drawing, it's started from the moment she learned to hold a pencil. From scribbles, to stick figures, to rough attempts, at drawing a person,
            she never stopped until she was able to get the gist of it. As the years go by, she explores different forms of art and plays around with different media.

            With the Artchive, we get to see a collection of Cami's artworks from years ago until now.
